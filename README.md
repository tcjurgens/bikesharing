# bikesharing
An analysis of NYC CitiBike Data using Tableau
## Overview
The Tableau story may be seen in its entirety at the following link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/thomas.jurgens/viz/Citibike_Challenge_16323616504160/NYCCitiBikeData?publish=yes

In this project we were tasked to analyze CitiBike bikeshare data in New York City, and to form some insight from this data so to be better imformed as to whether or not implementing a similar bikeshare program in Des Moines Iowa is logical or not.

## Summary
In conclusion, and as shown in the Results section prior, the bikesharing service is extremely popular in New York City. 
More specifically, we see that:
-most users are subscribers
-most users are male rather than female
-the bikes are most often used between 7-9am and 5-7pm, and used more often on weekdays than weekends

These above three insights may indicate that the bikes are most often used for individual commutes to/from work in the city. However, the bikes still have substantial and consistent use throughout the day on the weekends. 

It is fair to wonder if the bikes could meet similar demand in a city of a lesser scale such as Des Moines- and we must be sure that it would if we were to implement a similar program.

Some further analysis that I would suggest:
- Show start and end locations of bikes to see how far the average trip goes
- Analysis specific to the winter season (is the bikeshare program less popular when the weather is not nice out?)
- Usage by age charts (which age demographics are using bikeshare programs, is this a demographic we can target in Des Moines?)
